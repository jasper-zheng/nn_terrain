# Neural Stylus  

This is a Max external for Latent Terrain Synthesis, an algorithmic strategy for unfolding a neural synthesis model's latent space into a mountainous two-dimensional plane. The unfolded structure is a streamable "terrain", which can be used to access latent vectors of the synthesis model given coordinates on the 2D plane.

In progress... We're currently testing the model on acids-ircam's [RAVE](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde).
